# Auto Type Deduction in Modern C++

This example demonstrates how to use `auto` type deduction in C++. The `auto` keyword allows the compiler to automatically deduce the type of a variable from its initializer.

## Files

- **main.cpp**: This file contains the C++ code that demonstrates the use of `auto` for different types of variables, including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and vectors.
- **Makefile**: This file is used to compile the C++ code. It contains instructions for building the executable using `g++`.

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile the Code**: Open a terminal and navigate to the `01-auto_type_deduction` directory. Run the following command to compile the code:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

2. **Run the Executable**: After compiling, run the executable with the following command:
   ```bash
   ./auto_example
   ```

3. **Clean Up**: To remove the compiled executable, use the following command:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

## What You Will Learn

- How to use the `auto` keyword to simplify variable declarations.
- How `auto` can deduce different types based on the initializer.
- Basic usage of a Makefile to compile and clean a C++ project.

This example is a simple introduction to modern C++ features and helps you understand how type deduction can make your code cleaner and easier to read.
